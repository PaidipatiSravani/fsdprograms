    <p>Innovative teaching strategies donâ€™t always mean introducing the latest and greatest technology into the classroom. Instead, innovative 
        teaching is the process of proactively introducing new teaching strategies and methods into the classroom. The purpose of introducing
          these new teaching strategies and methods is to improve academic  outcomes and address real problems to promote equitable learning.  </p>
